# richweb-audio-grabber
An automated toolchain for grabbing audio files from the Richweb Conference's site using Ruby/Selenium and Perl

Run the Ruby/Selenium script from the command-line and output to a file named "richweb_out.txt" which is read by the Perl script.  Files are saved in the same directory as the scripts are located.

I realize these could be a bit more robust (i.e. not hard-coding in filenames), but I simply wanted something quick 'n' dirty that could get the job done.
